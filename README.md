## Motivation and Research

The motivation behind this project was to create a platform for people to access in depth astrology information without paying a premium. Premium content - freemium price.

When researching the current platforms and methods that many Australians use to get their astrology information. In general, users were confused as to where to get astrology information, often getting a basic horoscope from their internet homepage and were not aware of the depth and detail available in a daily horoscope. Some users who still used print media relied on the basic horoscope information found within their daily newspaper, but this was also often incomplete and not customised to their specific location or time of birth.

When surveying the options currently available within the market it was found that most sites charge a premium for access to detailed and accurate astrology information. Many of the surveyed sites had free options available but they considerably limited the information available to users without requiring a subscription. Some free options were available, however reviews of free to use vs pay to use sites vary dramatically in quality and ease of use. “In Retrograde” is designed to offer premium services at no cost to the end user.
 
“In Retrograde” is designed to be easy to use, with a singular focus on providing quality horoscope information due to API integration with leading horoscope data providers. It’s singular focus provides a streamlined user experience, and it is not incentivised to monetise its customer base through advertising or sharing of data with third parties.

Many horoscope apps just give information on Sun signs. “In Retrograde” is planned to give a more in depth analysis of horoscopes by determining not only your sun sign, but your moon, ascending and planet in signs and in houses reports. Just some features that “In Retrograde” will offer include life and love forecast reports, love compatibility reports as well as your daily, weekly and monthly forecasts.

## Development

### Web development technologies

Development of the project was centered around using React in the frontend and Node in the backend.

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

I implemented the use of CRACO, **C**reate **R**eact **A**pp **C**onfiguration **O**verride, an easy and comprehensible configuration layer for create-react-app, in order to utilise Tailwind CSS to style this application.
